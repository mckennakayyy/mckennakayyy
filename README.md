### Hi there! I'm McKenna ðŸ‘‹
Born and raised in Colorado, I moved to NYC seeking art and new experiences. While there, I have put my BFA in Stage Management to work in Educational and Off-Broadway productions managing casts and crews of all sizes. Communication and organization are my bread and butter, and skills I have really enjoyed transferring into my new career as a Software Developer. Theatre and live events demand constant flexibility and attention to detail, and I have found that coding demands those things as well. I'm looking forward to working on projects with teams and being given the chance to be apart of a larger community in my new career.
